# Getting Started

## Overview

Vite-create-react-library is a template for your next React open source library. Its based on Vite, React, Vocs and TypeScript.

You can develop your library with Vite Preview mode and Generate static docs with neat components powered by Vocs.

## Quick Start

### Bootstrap via CLI

Scaffold a new project with the command line:

:::code-group

```bash [npm]
npx degit github:alyalin/vite-create-react-library my-lib
```

```bash [pnpm]
pnpm degit github:alyalin/vite-create-react-library my-lib
```

```bash [bun]
bun degit github:alyalin/vite-create-react-library my-lib
```

```bash [yarn]
yarn degit github:alyalin/vite-create-react-library my-lib
```

:::

## Post Installation

After creating blank project you need configure some files for your future publish

::::steps

### Add meta data to `package.json`

First, we will configure `package.json`, add your data to these fields

```json [package.json]
{
  "name": "my-component-library",
  "version": "0.0.0",
  "author": "Your name",
  "description": "Describe your project",
  "license": "MIT"
}
```

### Configure Vocs config

Vocs 

```typescript [vocs.config.ts]
export default defineConfig({
    socials: [
      {
        icon: 'discord',
        link: '#',
      },
      {
        icon: 'github',
        link: '#',
      },
    ],
    editLink: {},
})
```

### Build your first React library component

Create React component under `lib` folder and import it to `main.ts`

```md
my-project/      
├── lib/
│   ├── MyComponent.tsx
│   ├── main.ts
│
```

```tsx [lib/MyComponent.tsx]
export const MyComponent = () => <>Do something</>;
```

```tsx [lib/main.ts]
export { MyComponent } from './MyComponent';
```

### Import Component into docs page

```mdx [docs/pages/index.mdx]
import { MyComponent } from '@/main' // path automatically resolves to lib folder

<MyComponent />

```

### Run

Next, run the development server:

```bash [Terminal]
npm run docs:dev
```

Then open up your browser to `http://localhost:5173`, and you can see your first page!

### Next Steps

Now that you have a basic documentation site up and running, you can learn more about how Vocs projects are structured in [Project Structure](/docs/structure).
